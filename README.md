# Machine Learning Project: Regression and Classification Models

Overview
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning models using Python's scikit-learn library. The models include Linear Regression for predicting student marks based on study time, Multiple Linear Regression for a combined feature set, Decision Tree Regression for precise predictions, Logistic Regression for binary classification of mushroom types based on cap shape, and Decision Tree Classification for mushroom classification.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn

Results
Each model's performance metrics are displayed for both training and test datasets.
Interpretation of metrics such as MSE, R-squared, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score is provided to evaluate model effectiveness.

Dataset
Student_Marks.csv: Contains data on student study time, number of courses, and corresponding marks.
mushroom_cleaned.csv: Dataset for mushroom characteristics including cap shape and classification.

Contributions
Contributions and feedback are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests to improve the project.
